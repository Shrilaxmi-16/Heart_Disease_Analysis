This repository contains a Python implementation of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, preprocessing, and machine learning classification using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** on the Heart Disease dataset. The project explores model performance, overfitting control, feature importance, and cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to have **heart disease** based on clinical and demographic features.  

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Provides an interpretable model but can overfit if depth is not controlled.  
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and generalization.  

By combining EDA, model training, and evaluation, this project helps identify **important risk factors** and **predictive features** for heart disease.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Heart Disease UCI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)  

The dataset contains **303 patient records** with **14 attributes** used to predict the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.  

### 🔹 Features Overview

- **Target Variable**  
  - `target`: Presence of heart disease (`1` = Disease, `0` = No Disease).  

- **Patient Demographics**  
  - `age`: Age of the patient (in years).  
  - `sex`: Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female).  

- **Chest Pain & Symptoms**  
  - `cp`: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).  

- **Blood Pressure & Cholesterol**  
  - `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).  
  - `chol`: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl).  
  - `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).  

- **Electrocardiographic & Exercise Data**  
  - `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2).  
  - `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved.  
  - `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).  
  - `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.  
  - `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0, 1, 2).  

- **Other Clinical Features**  
  - `ca`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0–3).  
  - `thal`: Thalassemia test result (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect).  

### 📈 Dataset Characteristics
- **Number of Instances**: 303  
- **Number of Features**: 13 predictors + 1 target variable  
- **Classes**: Heart Disease (1 = 165 cases), No Disease (0 = 138 cases)  
- **Imbalance**: Slightly skewed but balanced enough for binary classification tasks

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Data Overview** – Summary statistics, missing values check.  
2. **Target Distribution** – Class balance between patients with and without heart disease.  
3. **Correlation Heatmap** – Showed relationships between clinical measurements.  
4. **Boxplots & Violin Plots** – Compared cholesterol, blood pressure, and age across target groups.  
5. **Countplots for Categorical Features** – Visualized distributions of chest pain type, gender, thalassemia, etc.

## 🤖 Modeling
1. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
   - Controlled tree depth to reduce overfitting.  
   - Visualized the decision tree for interpretability.  

2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
   - Improved accuracy using an ensemble of decision trees.  
   - Feature importance ranking identified most predictive factors.  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Confusion matrix for error analysis.  
   - ROC curve comparison between Decision Tree and Random Forest.  
   - Cross-validation for robust performance check.  
   - Learning curves to evaluate bias vs variance.
